##Take a class##

You might start with DH201, the graduate introduction to digital
humanities, which we offer in the winter. In addition, the DH program
offers regular special-topics courses.

digital humanities, you can find information here:

Institute for Digital Research and Education offers frequent workshops
on topics like programming languages and supercomputing:
https://idre.ucla.edu/calendar.

**Organize a workshop**

If you can get three or more people together, I will work with you to
find a time to offer a workshop on anything I know about. If I don’t
know about it, I’ll help you find someone who does.

**Calendar of DH-Related Events**

Every week, I comb about 20 individual calendars to find events that might be interesting or useful to people who do DH. You can find that calendar here: http://www.cdh.ucla.edu/events/month/.

**Ask a question about statistics**

Did you know UCLA offers walk-in help for statistics questions? Every Monday through Thursday from 1 to 4pm, in 4919 Math Sciences. More info here: http://statistics.ats.ucla.edu/stat/services.htm.

**Obtain server space for a project**

CDH’s policy on server space is evolving, but as a first step, email John Lynch, CDH’s academic technology manager, at jlynch@humnet.ucla.edu. If you’re interested in buying your own space, I recommend Reclaim Hosting, which costs $25/year, including a domain name, and has excellent support: https://reclaimhosting.com/.

**Get help with teaching technology**

Email Tom Garbelotti, CDH’s instructional technology coordinator, at
tom@humnet.ucla.edu.

**Ask Miriam Posner something**

You can always just book a meeting with me at
