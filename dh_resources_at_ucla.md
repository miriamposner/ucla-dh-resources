You might start with DH201, the graduate introduction to digital
humanities, which we offer in the winter. In addition, the DH program
offers regular special-topics courses.

digital humanities, you can find information here:

# Talk to a human being

**Get general technical help**

For workaday technical help -- things like printers, email, and hardware issues -- you can speak to your [departmental technology analyst (DTA)](https://humtech.ucla.edu/people/) or stop by [HumTech](https://humtech.ucla.edu/) between 8am and 4pm on weekdays.

**Get help with mapping questions**

Make an appointment with Albert Kochaphum, the GIS assistant at UCLA’s
Institute for Digital Research and Education, by emailing
albertkun@idre.ucla.edu.

**Talk to a grad student about your problem**

Drop by Public Affairs 1020 to speak with a grad student research and instructional technology consultant, every weekday from 9 to 5.

**Get general digital scholarship advice**

Make an appointment with Zoe Borovsky, UCLA’s digital scholarship librarian, by emailing zoe@library.ucla.edu.

**Get advice on accessibility**

UCLA's [Office of Disabilities and Computing](https://dcp.ucla.edu/services/) offers accessibility evaluations to faculty and staff. (You might also consider installing [WAVE](https://wave.webaim.org/extension/), an accessibility plugin for Chrome and Firefox.)

**Get help with any question related to data analysis**

The Library's new [Data Science Center](https://www.library.ucla.edu/location/data-science-center/our-team) is a fantastic resource. You can book appointments online to speak with experts about data manipulation, R, Python, and many other topics. 

**Go to a workshop**

The library offers occasional [workshops on digital scholarship topics](https://calendar.library.ucla.edu/calendar/research-workshops/?cid=2190&t=d&d=0000-00-00&cal=2190). In addition, the
Institute for Digital Research and Education offers frequent workshops

**Ask a question about statistics**

Did you know UCLA offers walk-in help for statistics questions? Every Monday through Thursday from 1 to 4pm, in 4919 Math Sciences. More info here: http://statistics.ats.ucla.edu/stat/services.htm.

**Obtain server space for a project**

Faculty, staff, and graduate students in the Humanities can obtain server space from HumTech through a program called [HumSpace](https://humtech.ucla.edu/web-support/humspace/). 

If you need more space or different features than HumSpace offers, try emailing John Lynch, CDH’s academic technology manager, at jlynch@humnet.ucla.edu. If you’re interested in buying your own space, I recommend Reclaim Hosting, which costs $25/year, including a domain name, and has excellent support: https://reclaimhosting.com/.

**Get help with teaching technology**

Email Tom Garbelotti, HumTech’s instructional technology coordinator, at
tom@humnet.ucla.edu. You can also find some resources on [HumTech's website](https://humtech.ucla.edu/instructional-support/).
