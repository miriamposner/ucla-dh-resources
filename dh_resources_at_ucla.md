**Obtain server space for a project**

CDH’s policy on server space is evolving, but as a first step, email John Lynch, CDH’s academic technology manager, at jlynch@humnet.ucla.edu. If you’re interested in buying your own space, I recommend Reclaim Hosting, which costs $25/year, including a domain name, and has excellent support: https://reclaimhosting.com/.
